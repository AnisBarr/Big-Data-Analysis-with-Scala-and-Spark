# Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark

This project contains my submissions for the Coursera MOOC [Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data/), given by EPFL, and taught by Prof. Heather C. Miller.

## Timeline

* **Date Started**: March 14, 2017

* **Date Completed**: -

## Assignments

### Programming Assignment 1: Wikipedia

* **Week**: 1

* **Lesson**: Basics of Spark's RDDs

* **Description**: "In this assignment, we'll use our full-text data from Wikipedia to produce a rudimentary metric of how popular a programming language is, in an effort to see if our Wikipedia-based rankings bear any relation to the popular Red Monk rankings."

* **Grade**: 10 / 10

### Programming Assignment 2: StackOverflow

* **Week**: 2 (two-week long assignment)

* **Lesson**: Reduction Operations & Distributed Key-Value Pairs

* **Description**: "The overall goal of this assignment is to implement a distributed k-means algorithm which clusters posts on the popular question-answer platform StackOverflow according to their score. Moreover, this clustering should be executed in parallel for different programming languages, and the results should be compared."

* **Grade**: 10 / 10

### Programming Assignment 3: Time Usage

* **Week**: 4

* **Lesson**: SQL, Dataframes, and Datasets

* **Description**: "The dataset is provided by Kaggle and is documented here: https://www.kaggle.com/bls/american-time-use-survey"

* **Grade**: -

## Note

Resource files have to be unzipped for the code to work.
